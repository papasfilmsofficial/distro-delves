<!--- Verify first that your Distro was not already submitted! -->

## openSUSE Tumbleweed
<!--- Required: What is the name, version, etc -->

## Rolling release
<!--- Optional: This helps in planning future episodes -->

## Power user (Maybe also a desktop user that is familiarised with Linux)
<!--- Optional: This helps set the expectation in how compatible it is with the Distro Delve script -->

## x86_64 , i583 , aarch64 , ppc64le
<!--- Optional: x86, x64, arm, etc -->

## It has the best administrator tools I have ever seen... I'm talking about YaST2 (which is also the installer!)
<!--- Optional: Why should people be excited about this distro? -->
